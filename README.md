# Protobuf messages definitions

This repo defines a Rust crate to import Beep's Protobuf packages.

## Adding a Protobuf package and messages

See `./src/proto/test.proto` for an example Protobuf package and messages.
Write your own Protobuf files inside this `./src/proto/` directory.

Then define the module and include the generated structs in the `./src/lib.rs` file, as seen in that file.
This way, code including that crate can `use` the module (make it `pub`).

Here is a link to [Protobuf version 3's language documentation](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/).

## Usage

To use the Protobuf messages in your Rust code, structs generated by Prost, you need the `protoc` Protobuf compiler.
Here is a link to [Protoc's installation](https://protobuf.dev/installation/).

You can use version tags for stable Protobuf messages, or the SHA1 of your branch if you are working on API changes.

To use the generated structs, use the module you defined in the library.
Or you could define the module in your code and only use the library for generating the structs.
